    <h1>Ricardo M. Amador</h1>
  <p>Ricardo M. Amador (he/him) is a junior at UC San Diego majoring in Data Science 
    at the HalicioÄŸlu Data Science Institute. 
    Although he originally planned to major in Computer Science, during the summer 
    before high school junior year, Ricardo participated in the LUCIR Study and, as a 
    result, discovered Data Science. This study, taking place in his hometown of 
    Salinas, CA, aimed to find out if conventional cleaning products were harmful to 
    health, specifically the health of Latinas and their families in his community. 
    Ricardo and his team not only found that many conventional cleaning products 
    contained carcinogens and endocrine disruptors that were toxic and harmful but 
    also identified cleaner, healthier products and educated his community about 
    making better decisions when cleaning their homes. This study resonated deeply 
    with Ricardo and he hopes that, with the field of Data Science, he will be able to 
    conduct more similar studies and make a positive impact on his Latinx community.</p>
